The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Evermeet.</em></strong>&nbsp;The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerun. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland.</p>\r\n<p>Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerun for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Halruaa.</em></strong>&nbsp;Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerun who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic.</p>\r\n<p>Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerun for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Kara-Tur.</em></strong>&nbsp;The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faer&ucirc;n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faer&ucirc;n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin.</p>\r\n<p>The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faer&ucirc;n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Mulhorand.</em></strong>&nbsp;From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is a lien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faer&ucirc;n. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faer&ucirc;n.</p>\r\n<p>Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Sossal.</em></strong>&nbsp;Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white.</p>\r\n<p>Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Zakhara.</em></strong>&nbsp;As the saying goes among those in Faer&ucirc;n who know of the place, \"To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.\" Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faer&ucirc;n for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have.</p>\r\n<p>You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>The Underdark.</em></strong>&nbsp;Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child.</p>\r\n<p>If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your reason for leaving \"home\" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.</p>","avatarUrl":null,"largeAvatarUrl":null,"suggestedCharacteristicsDescription":"<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\r\n<h2 id=\"toc5\">Personality Traits</h2>\r\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th>Personality Trait</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others' space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don't comprehend.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\r\n<h2 id=\"toc6\">Ideals</h2>\r\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th>Ideal</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td><strong>Open.</strong>&nbsp;I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.

Hier heb ik samen met mijn dorpsgenoten een rol vervuld\nin het verbouwen en verwerken van gewassen voor ons volk. Ons dorp aanbidt de\nDawnfather. Hij leidt ons al jaren naar succesvolle oogsten. \n\n\n\n\n\nIk heb mijn\nouders nooit gekend en ben op jonge leeftijd geadopteerd door Elaera en Duncan\nScaletail. Ik heb een paar maanden geleden een briefje gekregen van mijn\npleegouders, geschreven door mijn ouders. Hier staat in dat ze mij moesten\nverlaten toen ik nog maar een baby was voor “Het grotere goed”. Meer staat er\nniet in de brief. Het enige wat er bij het briefje zat was een sleutel waarvan\nik de functie niet weet en een extravagant uitziende lier (lyre). Ik speel\nregelmatig op deze lier als ik mij verveel.\n\n\n\n\n\nHet zit in onze\naard om gasten in nood altijd te helpen waar mogelijk. Zo verwelkomden wij met\nregelmaat avonturiers tijdens hun reis en boden wij hen eten, onderdak,\nmedicatie, en triage aan. Helaas waren niet alle gasten goedgezind en werd er\nsporadisch misbruik gemaakt van onze goodwill. Zo zijn onze velden en huizen in\nhet verleden vaak geplunderd. Om deze reden heb ik mij 10 jaar geleden\naangeboden om de rol als beschermer van het dorp op mij te nemen. Over de span\nvan 4 jaar ben ik bekwaam geworden met het dragen van zware, beschermende\nuitrusting en mijn strijdbijl. Dit was meer bedoeld als dreiging dan dat ik het\ndaadwerkelijk gebruikte. Ons volk probeert conflict namelijk ten allen tijde te\nvoorkomen door in gesprek te gaan en een goed bord zelfgemaakt eten aan te\nbieden. Enkele jaren later ben ik als leerling bij onze hoofdpriester in\nopleiding gegaan om de fijne kneepjes van magie onder de knie te krijgen. De\nfocus van mijn training lag bij helende magie om mijn volk en avonturiers te\nhelpen.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn de tijd dat ik\nniet nodig was ging ik op pad in de natuur om naar plantaardige en dierlijke\ningrediënten te zoeken voor mijn brouwsels. De effecten van verschillende\nsoorten dranken heb proefgewijs geleerd en naslagwerk voor bijgehouden.\nHopelijk komt deze kennis nog eens van pas. Wanneer ik langer overbodig was, ging\nik verder weg op zoek naar zeldzamere ingrediënten, en was ik ook actief op\nzoek naar oude tempels en grotten met religieuze doeleinden. Ik heb namelijk\neen grote interesse voor religie ontwikkeld tijdens mijn training bij de\nhoofdpriester. Tijdens een van deze reizen heb ik in een (?

De ingrediënten staan er allemaal op (Smugglers\nWeed, ?, ?, ?, en ?), maar het stuk over het effect van de drank is\nweggebrand. \n\n\n\n\n\nEnkele weken\ngeleden sprak ik een avonturier uit Port Cavado die mij vertelde over een\nveiling waar één van de kruiden op mijn recept geveild wordt, het Smugglers\nWeed. Aangezien er net een nieuwe aanwas aan beschermers is opgeleid, en ik wat\nouder begin te worden, heb ik ervoor gekozen om het dorp te verlaten, en te\nbeginnen aan een zoektocht naar mijn ouders en de ingrediënten voor de\nonbekende drank. De start van mijn avontuur zal in Port Cavado zijn, waar het\nbefaamde Smugglers Weed wordt geveild.\n\n\n\n","otherNotes":null},"traits":{"personalityTraits":"","ideals":"","bonds":null,"flaws":null,"appearance":null},"preferences":{"useHomebrewContent":true,"progressionType":1,"encumbranceType":2,"ignoreCoinWeight":true,"hitPointType":2,"showUnarmedStrike":true,"showScaledSpells":true,"primarySense":5,"primaryMovement":1,"privacyType":3,"sharingType":2,"abilityScoreDisplayType":2,"enforceFeatRules":true,"enforceMulticlassRules":true,"enableOptionalClassFeatures":true,"enableOptionalOrigins":true,"enableDarkMode":false,"enableContainerCurrency":false},"configuration":{"startingEquipmentType":3,"abilityScoreType":2,"showHelpText":false},"lifestyle":null,"inventory":[{"id":1387453877,"entityTypeId":1439493548,"definition":{"id":8,"baseTypeId":701257905,"entityTypeId":701257905,"definitionKey":"701257905:8","canEquip":true,"magic":false,"name":"Shield","snippet":null,"weight":6.00,"weightMultiplier":1,"capacity":null,"capacityWeight":0,"type":"Shield","description":"<p>A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand.
